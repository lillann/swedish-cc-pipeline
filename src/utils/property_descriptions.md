## Detailed Property Descriptions & Annotation Guidelines

### Core Content Properties

#### 1. Content Integrity

**What we're measuring**: Completeness and technical quality of the content itself, regardless of navigation ratio.

##### Values & Criteria:

**`complete`** - Full, intact content as intended
- Content appears complete with proper beginning, middle, and end
- All essential elements present (introduction, body, conclusion where appropriate)
- No obvious truncation or missing sections
- Example: Complete articles, full tutorials, intact documents

**`mostly_complete`** - Minor elements missing but core content intact
- Core content is complete but some secondary elements may be missing
- Minor truncation that doesn't affect main message
- Example: Article with truncated comments, missing sidebar content, partial author bio

**`fragment`** - Incomplete content, missing significant portions
- Missing introduction, conclusion, or substantial middle sections
- Truncated mid-sentence or mid-paragraph
- Content feels incomplete or cut off
- Example: Search result snippets, article excerpts, broken crawls, partial downloads

**`severely_degraded`** - Broken, unreadable, or corrupted content
- Encoding errors, scrambled text, missing characters
- Severely malformed HTML rendering as gibberish
- Technical corruption making content unreadable
- Example: �&$^%*@# characters, completely broken formatting, corrupted files

##### Key Decision Points:
- **Content completeness**: Does the content feel like a complete unit of information?
- **Technical integrity**: Is the content technically readable and properly formatted?
- **Fragment vs. complete**: Independent of navigation - is the actual content complete?
- **Degraded vs. fragment**: Degraded has technical issues; fragment is just incomplete

**Note**: Documents may end with the special tag `<content_truncated>`, indicating upstream length-based truncation due to processing constraints. Do not penalize Content Integrity due to this truncation signal; assess integrity based on the visible content's coherence and technical readability, ignoring the artificial cutoff.

#### 2. Content Ratio

**What we're measuring**: How much of the document is actual content vs. navigation, UI elements, and structural markup.

##### Values & Criteria:

**`complete_content`** - 90-100% meaningful content
- Full articles, papers, tutorials with minimal navigation
- Clean text with proper paragraphs and structure
- Example: A Wikipedia article, academic paper, complete blog post

**`mostly_content`** - 70-89% meaningful content  
- Complete documents with some navigation elements (header, footer, sidebar)
- Minor UI elements that don't disrupt reading
- Example: News articles with standard website navigation

**`mixed_content`** - 40-69% meaningful content
- Significant navigation mixed throughout content
- Multiple sidebars, ads, or UI elements interrupting text
- Example: E-commerce product pages with reviews mixed with purchase options

**`mostly_navigation`** - 10-39% meaningful content
- Predominantly menus, links, headers, footers
- Content overwhelmed by structural elements
- Example: Site maps, navigation pages, heavily UI-focused pages

**`minimal_content`** - 0-9% meaningful content
- Almost entirely navigation, UI elements, or structural markup
- Very little readable content present
- Example: Empty pages, pure navigation menus, error pages with minimal text

##### Key Decision Points:
- Focus on the **ratio of readable text to navigation/UI elements**
- **Count only substantive content**, ignore boilerplate and structural elements
- **Mixed vs. mostly_navigation**: Can you read it as coherent content despite distractions?

---

#### 3. Content Length

**What we're measuring**: Amount of substantive content, ignoring navigation and boilerplate.

##### Values & Criteria:

**`substantial`** - 2,000+ words of meaningful content
- Long-form, comprehensive content that provides in-depth coverage of a topic
- Typically includes detailed analysis, multiple sections or chapters, extensive research, or thorough exploration of complex subjects
- Examples: White papers, research reports, e-books, long-form journalism

**`moderate`** - 500–2,000 words of meaningful content
- Standard-length content that offers meaningful coverage while remaining focused and digestible
- Balances depth with accessibility; provides enough detail to be informative without overwhelming readers
- Examples: Typical blog posts, news articles, product reviews, how-to guides

**`brief`** - 100–500 words of meaningful content
- Short, focused content that delivers key information quickly and efficiently
- Gets straight to the point while still providing value and context
- Examples: News briefs, product descriptions, FAQs, short blog posts

**`minimal`** - Under 100 words of meaningful content
- Very short content that provides only essential information or serves as a quick reference
- Designed for rapid consumption or specific micro-purposes
- Examples: Social media posts, announcements, abstracts, snippets, navigation pages

##### Measurement Tips:
- **Count only readable content of value**: include article body and substantive headings/captions; exclude headers/footers, menus/sidebars, related links, share/consent UI, pagination, ads, and boilerplate.
- **Focus on substantive information**, not filler words
- **Complete thoughts matter more than exact word counts**
- **Contextual adjustment**: Thresholds are guidelines and can be adjusted based on specific use cases and typical content. Academic contexts may shift ranges upward, while social media contexts may shift them downward.

- No knowledge transfer potential
- Example: Pure entertainment, transactions, legal boilerplate

##### Disambiguation tips
- Explanatory vs Educational: explanations alone ≠ educational design; require intent to teach plus scaffolding for Basic+
- Reference docs: typically Minimal; promote to Basic/Moderate when guided “how-to” segments or curated examples exist
- Reviews/op-eds: None/Minimal unless they include actionable how-to guidance designed for learning

##### Automation heuristics
- Keywords: Objectives/Outcomes, Lesson, Exercise/Quiz, Homework, Assessment, Syllabus, Module, Unit, Learning Goals
- Structure: numbered steps + prerequisites/requirements → Basic; add practice tasks/solutions → Moderate; syllabus/modules/assessments → High
- Signals of non-edu mix: heavy CTAs/ads or product pitches → cap at Minimal unless clear instructional scaffolding

##### Quick decision tree
- Are there explicit learning goals or a syllabus? → High
- Else, are there step-by-step instructions with examples/exercises? → Moderate
- Else, are there explanatory sections intended to teach basics? → Basic
- Else, is there any minor instructional element? → Minimal
- Otherwise → None

##### Borderline examples
- API reference with examples but no guidance → Minimal to Basic (depending on clarity/examples)
- Blog post explaining concept with analogies and one example → Basic
- Tutorial with tasks, checkpoints, and solutions → High
- Product documentation with “Getting Started” and “How-To” flows → Moderate

##### Educational Indicators:
- **Learning objectives**: Clear goals for what reader should learn
- **Skill progression**: Builds from basic to advanced concepts
- **Examples and practice**: Provides concrete examples or exercises
- **Knowledge transfer**: Concepts applicable beyond immediate context

---

#### 11. Reasoning Indicators

**What we're measuring**: Presence and quality of logical reasoning, analysis, and explanatory content.

##### Values & Criteria:

- Explains how or why things work
- Shows cause-effect relationships clearly
- Educational reasoning that builds understanding
- Logical connections between concepts
- Example: Good tutorials, educational content, how-to explanations

**`basic_reasoning`** - Simple logical connections
- Some logical connections between ideas
- Basic explanations of concepts or processes
- Elementary analytical thinking
- Simple cause-effect relationships
- Example: Basic explanations, simple arguments, elementary analysis

**`minimal`** - Limited reasoning, mostly descriptive

- Simple factual listing without connections
- Narrative content without analysis
- No logical argumentation or explanation
- Example: Simple lists, basic narratives, pure description

##### Thinking-trace signals (what to look for)
- Stepwise structure: numbered steps in proofs/derivations/solutions; “First… therefore… hence… so…”
- Hypothesis and test: assumptions, intermediate results, counterexamples, sanity checks
- Tool- or method-calls: named algorithms, theorems, lemmas, or procedures invoked and justified
- Error analysis or reflection: “we tried X, failed because Y, so we…”, “limitations,” “edge cases”
- Intermediate artifacts: scratch calculations, partial code reasoning, sub-problems and sub-claims

##### Disambiguation rules
- Explanatory vs Analytical: explanations tell how; analytical shows multi-step inference with evidence and intermediate claims
- Worked example vs Mere answer: worked examples expose steps and justification; mere answers without steps are not reasoning-rich
- Procedural vs Reasoning: procedural lists actions; reasoning links actions via logic, evidence, or constraints

##### Automation heuristics
- Lexical cues: because, therefore, thus, hence, suppose/assume, we conclude, by induction, lemma/theorem/proof, O(n), hypothesis, counterexample
- Structure cues: presence of proof blocks, derivations (e.g., “Proof.”, “QED”, TeX environments), multi-step numeric calculations
- Program reasoning: code comments like “// invariant”, “// complexity”, pre/post-conditions, test reasoning
- Thresholding: count reasoning cues per 1k tokens; with ≥2 structural cues or ≥5 lexical cues → at least explanatory; proofs/derivations → analytical

##### Quick decision tree
- Is there a proof/derivation or multi-step argument with intermediate claims? → analytical
- Else, does it explain why/how with cause-effect and logical links? → explanatory
- Else, are there simple logical connections or one-step justifications? → basic_reasoning
- Else, does it mostly describe without connecting ideas? → minimal/none

##### Borderline examples
- Answer-only solutions (final numeric result without steps) → minimal
- Step-by-step math solution with intermediate equations → analytical
- “How it works” article connecting 2–3 causal steps without data → explanatory
- Troubleshooting log with attempts and justifications → analytical if causal chain is explicit; otherwise explanatory

##### Key Reasoning Patterns to Identify:
- **Cause-effect**: "Because X, therefore Y"
- **Problem-solution**: Identifies problems and proposes solutions
- **Comparison**: Analyzes similarities and differences
- **Logical progression**: Ideas build on previous ideas
- **Evidence-based conclusions**: Draws conclusions from presented evidence
